## Overview

Some providers require authentication or cookies to access their API. This guide will show you how to set cookies and authenticate with these providers in the `g4f` package.

## Setting Cookies

<Accordion title="Setting Cookies for a Provider">
To set cookies for a specific provider, you can use the `set_cookies` function from the `g4f.cookies` module:

```python
from g4f.cookies import set_cookies

set_cookies(".bing.com", {
  "_U": "cookie value"
})
set_cookies(".google.com", {
  "__Secure-1PSID": "cookie value" 
})
```

The `set_cookies` function takes two arguments:
1. The domain name of the provider (e.g. `.bing.com`, `.google.com`)
2. A dictionary of cookie names and values

Make sure to set the correct domain and provide the necessary cookie values required by the provider.
</Accordion>

## Authentication

<Accordion title="Authenticating with a Provider">
Some providers like OpenAI require an access token for authentication. You can pass the access token when creating a completion:

```python
from g4f.Provider import OpenaiChat

response = OpenaiChat.create_completion(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    auth="your_access_token_here"
)
```

Use the `auth` parameter and provide your access token as a string.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Automatically Reading Cookies">
The `g4f` package can automatically read cookies from your web browser using the `browser_cookie3` library.

<Note>
Make sure you have logged into the provider's website on your browser for this to work.
</Note>

It supports reading cookies from the following browsers:
- Google Chrome 
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Opera
- Brave

No additional configuration is needed. The package will attempt to read the required cookies automatically.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Cookies Not Being Set">
If the cookies are not being set properly, make sure:
- You are using the correct domain name 
- The cookie names and values are accurate
- You have the necessary permissions to set cookies
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
If you encounter authentication errors, double check that:
- Your access token is valid and not expired
- You are passing the token in the `auth` parameter
- The provider supports authentication via access tokens
</Accordion>

## Example

Here's an example of setting cookies and using authentication:

```python
from g4f.cookies import set_cookies
from g4f.Provider import Bing, OpenaiChat

# Set cookies
set_cookies(".bing.com", {
  "_U": "your_bing_cookie_here"
})

# Create completion with Bing
response = Bing.create_completion(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello Bing"}]
)

# Create completion with OpenAI authentication
response = OpenaiChat.create_completion(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello OpenAI"}],
    auth="your_openai_access_token"
)
```

By setting the appropriate cookies and providing authentication, you can successfully use providers that require them.

## Conclusion

Adding cookies and authentication is straightforward with the `g4f` package. Use the `set_cookies` function to manually set cookies or let the package automatically read them from your browser. For providers needing authentication, pass your access token using the `auth` parameter.
