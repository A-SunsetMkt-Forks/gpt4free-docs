### Required dependencies
make sure to install the required dependencies by running 

```
pip install g4f[local]
```

or

```
pip install -U gpt4all
```
___

### Basic usage example

```jsx
from g4f.local import LocalClient

client   = LocalClient()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model    = 'orca-mini-3b',
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
    stream   = True
)

for token in response:
    print(token.choices[0].delta.content or "")
```

Upon first use, there will be a prompt asking you if you wish to download the model. If you respond with `y`, G4F will go ahead and download the model for you.

You can also manually place supported models into [`./g4f/local/models/`](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free/tree/main/g4f/local/models)

You can get a list of the current supported models by running:

```jsx
from g4f.local import LocalClient

client   = LocalClient()
client.list_models()
```
