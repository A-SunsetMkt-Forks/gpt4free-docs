  Get up and running with G4F in no time! Learn the basics and start generating text and images effortlessly.
</Card>

## Installation

To get started with G4F, you first need to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install -U g4f
```

<Tip>
  Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system.
</Tip>

## Text Generation

G4F makes it easy to generate text using various language models. Here's a basic example of how to generate text using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model:

```python
import g4f

response = g4f.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello! How are you?"}]
)

print(response)
```

<Accordion title="Expected Output">
```
Hello! As an AI language model, I don't have feelings, but I'm functioning properly and ready to assist you. How may I help you today?
```
</Accordion>

You can customize the generated text by specifying additional parameters:

<ParamField path="model" type="string">
  The name of the language model to use for text generation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="messages" type="list">
  A list of message objects representing the conversation history.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="temperature" type="float">
  Controls the randomness of the generated text. Higher values result in more random output.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="max_tokens" type="integer">
  The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
</ParamField>

## Image Generation

G4F also supports generating images using various image models. Here's an example of how to generate an image using the `dall-e` model:

```python
import g4f

response = g4f.ImageGeneration.create(
    model="dall-e",
    prompt="a white siamese cat"
)

image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
print(image_url)
```

<Accordion title="Expected Output">
```
https://example.com/generated_image.jpg
```
</Accordion>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://example.com/generated_image.jpg" alt="Generated Image" />
</Frame>

Similar to text generation, you can customize the image generation process:

<ParamField path="model" type="string">
  The name of the image model to use for generation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="prompt" type="string">
  A text description of the image you want to generate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="num_images" type="integer">
  The number of images to generate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="size" type="string">
  The size of the generated images (e.g., "256x256", "512x512").
</ParamField>

## Streaming Responses

G4F supports streaming responses for both text and image generation. This allows you to receive the generated content in real-time as it is being produced. Here's an example of streaming text generation:

```python
import g4f

response = g4f.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story."}],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

<Accordion title="Expected Output">
```
Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, there lived a young girl named Lily. She was known throughout the village for her kindness and her love for animals. Every day, Lily would venture into the nearby forest to explore and play with her animal friends.

One particularly sunny morning, Lily decided to go deeper into the forest than she had ever gone before. As she walked, she stumbled upon a hidden grove filled with beautiful, vibrant flowers. In the center of the grove stood a majestic, ancient tree with a peculiar door carved into its trunk.

Curiosity got the better of Lily, and she cautiously approached the door. With a gentle push, the door creaked open, revealing a magical world beyond. Lily stepped through the doorway and found herself in an enchanted forest, unlike anything she had ever seen before.

Streaming is also available for image generation:

```python
import g4f

response = g4f.ImageGeneration.create(
    model="dall-e",
    prompt="a majestic landscape",
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
    # Process each image chunk as it arrives
    # You can display or save the partial image here
    print("Received image chunk:", len(chunk))
```

## Error Handling

When using G4F, it's important to handle potential errors that may occur during the generation process. Here's an example of how to handle errors:

```python
import g4f

try:
    response = g4f.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="non-existent-model",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
    )
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", str(e))
```

<Accordion title="Expected Output">
```
An error occurred: Model not found: non-existent-model
```
</Accordion>

## Conclusion

You now have a solid foundation for using G4F to generate text and images. Feel free to explore the different models, parameters, and features available to unleash your creativity!
