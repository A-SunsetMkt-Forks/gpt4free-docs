<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Install Docker">
 G4F can be run using [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/). Ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.
 You can check if you have `Docker` installed by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
user@mac-air:~$ docker --version
> Docker version 23.0.5, build bc4487a
```
If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
</Step>
<Step title="Pull the g4f Docker image">
 You can pull the `g4f` Docker image using the following command:
```bash
docker pull hlohaus789/g4f
```
This will download the latest version of the g4f Docker image.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the g4f Docker container">
 Once the image is pulled, you can run the g4f Docker container with the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 1337:1337 -p 7900:7900 --shm-size="2g" -v ${PWD}/hardir:/app/hardir hlohaus789/g4f:latest
```
This command will start the g4f container and expose the necessary ports.
</Step>
<Step title="Access the Web UI">
 After starting the container, you can access the included web client at:
 ```
 http://localhost:8080/chat/
 ```
 Alternatively, you can set the API base in your own client to:
 ```
 http://localhost:1337/v1
 ```

 This can be used with the openai python package, [API Specifications](/docs/api-docs/)
</Step>
<Step title="(Optional) View the container desktop">
 If you need to log in to a provider, you can view the desktop from the container at:
 ```
 http://localhost:7900/?autoconnect=1&resize=scale&password=secret
 ```
</Step>
All set! You now have g4f running in a Docker container. You can navigate to [Basic Usage](/docs/get-started/quickstart/use) for further instructions.
