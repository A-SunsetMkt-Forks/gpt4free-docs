 G4F requires [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) to run. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
 You can check if you have `Python` installed by running the following command in your terminal:

user@mac-air:~$ python3 --version
> Python 3.11.6
```
 Additionally, make sure you have `git` installed. You can check this by running:
```bash
user@mac-air:~$ git --version
> git version 2.34.1
```
</Step>
<Step title="Clone the g4f repository">
 You can clone the `g4f` repository using `git`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/g4f/g4f.git
```
 This will create a local copy of the `g4f` repository on your machine.

<Step title="Install dependencies">
 Navigate into the cloned `g4f` directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd g4f
pip install -r requirements.txt
